TODO

cnn error not shrinking.  i checked coordinates on .npy cctf images and they seem unaligned.
but images too small to be sure

need to make fewer-frames versions at full-size.  refactor code to remove dups.

put functions in single cctfTools file?  stop running code from same file as functions.  ruins imports.

add code to easily visualize coordinates on frames at each step.

get numFrames from function, not code.  to adjust across framework
