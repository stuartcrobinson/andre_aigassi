tracking basketball:  first 10 seconnds:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKIOqbx3sbU

maskrcnn is bad at tracking basketballs.  stick to tennis :( 

but what about using lstm for predicting game play :(  

BOXING IDEA:

train lstm on kick boxing pose data.  then input stick figures and watch them go at it.  
boxing: great compilation with minimal slo-mo bits - but blurry a lot 

editing stick figures (starting points for lstm kickboxing stickfigure demo):

use this?  https://www.math10.com/en/geometry/geogebra/geogebra.html

user will have to copy and paste source.  app will have to parse to get coordinates and connections. 

no use this svg builder!!!!

pose overlay!  creepy!  puts manikin over joints

current working code is here, cos the python library only worked from inside this project folder
/Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/Mask_RCNN

NOTES:

maskrcnn is better than openpose at identifying lots of blurry small people who aren't hugging
openpose is better at identifying people even if they're hugging.  but not by much

test if processing faster on smaller image... ?  no.  not faster for smaller images.


PLAN:

in a p2 ec2 instance, for each video frame:

1.  OpenPose    - get pose points for main biggest closest tennis player
                - plot points on body
                - -- this is for identifying when a swing happens, and if forehand or backhand
             

2.  MaskRCNN    - get polygons and bounding rectangles for: 
                    - tennis racket
                    - sport ball
                - this is to visually trace swings and the ball 

how to draw on images in video 



./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/stanford_single_swing.mp4 --write_video /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/out/single_swing.avi --write_json /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/out
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/stanford_single_backhand.mov --write_video /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/out/stanford_single_backhand/stanford_single_backhand.avi --write_json /Users/stuartrobinson/repos/computervision/attempt1/tennis_video/out/stanford_single_backhand



splitting video into frames:

vlc sucks.  skips frames.

trying ffmpeg: https://www.bugcodemaster.com/article/extract-images-frame-frame-video-file-using-ffmpeg

ffmpeg -i video.webm thumb%04d.jpg -hide_banner
ffmpeg -i stanford_single_backhand.mov thumb%05d.png
ffmpeg -i stanford_single_swing.mp4 ./frames/stanford_single_swing/thumb%05d.png

FFMPEG WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! f yeah    

now do maskrcnn per saved frame.
- how to save python image? 
 - https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/commit/bc8f148b820ebd45246ed358a120c99b09798d71 !! works great 


??? how to get framerate for video?

ffmpeg -i videoname

29.97 fps for stanford_single_backhand.mov

??? how to get resolution?

https://superuser.com/questions/841235/how-do-i-use-ffmpeg-to-get-the-video-resolution

ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=width,height -of csv=s=x:p=0 stanford_single_backhand.mov

1280x720 for stanford_single_backhand.mov


how to combine frames into video?

http://hamelot.io/visualization/using-ffmpeg-to-convert-a-set-of-images-into-a-video/

ffmpeg -r 30 -s 1280x720 -i thumb%05d.png.jpg -vcodec libx264 -crf 25  -pix_fmt yuv420p test.mp4

works!

now, how to segment in higher quality?  png instead of jpg 



compare pose results (to find the closer tennis player) by comparing distance between points 1 and 8 -- neck and midhip. 
3 elements per bodypart (x, y, strength?)
