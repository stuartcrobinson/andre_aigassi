good cnn slides: https://www.slideshare.net/jbhuang/lecture-29-convolutional-neural-networks-computer-vision-spring2015


novel ?

1.  image stabilization.
2.  do CNN on image difference (pixel-wise)

use diff as input to cnn 

inputs:

diff
roi as mask ?  or as coordinates??????




 or as top-left/bottom-right offset

attention layer 




TODO
- use homography to align consecutive images.  (during training, do this per object to track???
- dont use temporal filter.  use diff image and init bounding box coordinates --> next coordinates.
- --- lstm on fully connected bit.
- align images before getting diffs

we only need pair-wise homography.  series of frames dont need to line up.

attention layer?
